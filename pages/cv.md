## Research

I am heavily interested in algorithms and data structures. Recently, I have been
interested in cryptography, numerical algorithms, and geometry.

In general, I enjoy discussing and doing research in Theoretical Computer Science
or any interdisciplinary field that combines Theoretical Computer Science with
real-life applications.

### Bayesian Election Auditing | [P, C] github.com/zrygan/Bayesian-Election-Auditing

Apr 2025-

- Implementing a Go-based election auditing system using the Pólya urn model and
  Bayesian audit techniques based on Rivest & Shen (2012).
- Developing a companion essay in Jupyter Book explaining election integrity, counting challenges, and statistical uncertainty. Focused on transparent, probabilistic approaches to verifying election outcomes.

### Raytracer-Rust | [C] github.com/zrygan/Raytracer

Mar 2025–

- Rewrote and optimized a two-dimensional ray tracer in Rust to improve low-level
  performance, with emphasis on memory management and lifetime handling.
- Achieved 12 times performance improvement over Raytracer-Python.
- The project simulates emitters and absorbers using geometric and numerical
  algorithms, including parametric equations, linear spaces, and trigonometry.

### Filipino Language Case Study | [P] github.com/zrygan/Filipino-Case- and [C] github.com/zrygan/LanguageTool-Case-Study

Mar 2025–Apr 2025

- Co-authored a case study on common Filipino and Bikol language grammar and style mistakes, proposing automated solutions using finite-state automata.
- The project also analyzed Filipino grammar rules that are difficult or impossible to model using regular languages, highlighting limitations in formal language theory.
- Joint project with Stephen Borja and Justin Ching.

### Nachos, Chips, & Dips: Crunching Cryptos, Algos, and Symbols | [T]

Mar 2025
