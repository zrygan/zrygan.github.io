## Research
I do independent research on Theoretical Computer Sciences. Recently, I have been interested in parallel algorithms, cryptography, and advanced data structures. On occasion, I work on programming language theory: compilers, interpreters, and syntax.

## Projects
- **Mar 2025–Present**  
  **C-MEN** | [github.com/zrygan/c-men](https://github.com/zrygan/c-men)  
  A project that implements memoization for recursive functions in C. By passing a recursive function (like the recursive Fibonacci Sequence algorithm) in the memoization function, it reduces computation time by memoizing the recursive function.

- **Feb 2025–Present**  
  **Raytracer** | [github.com/zrygan/Raytracer](https://github.com/zrygan/Raytracer)  
  A project written in Python exploring concepts in two-dimensional ray tracing algorithms.

- **Oct 2024–Present**  
  **The tt**  
  Beginning as a small project for the students I tutor, The Turing Tome (tt) is a collection of notes, articles, and problems that cover topics like discrete structures, computational complexity theory, and more.

## Academic Engagement
